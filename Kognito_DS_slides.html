Since there's no DS team at Kognito, I thought it'd be best to start with some key questions/directions

# **A multitude of data points...**

???
- Lots of data is created as users interact with Kognito sims
- Lots of possibility for data-driven development

# **How can data drive revenue?**

???
- The big business question that drives DS work:

---

class: inverse, left, middle

.xxlarge[
* Marketing materials and targeting

* User retention and UX

* Productize user score data
]

???
Three main ways that I can see for data to drive revenue:
- Using data to improve marketing by tailoring existing materials and targeting marketing to audiences
- Key insights can help suggest improvements to user retention and UX
- Finally, productizing score data can open new revenue streams

---

# Plan to get there:

.xxlarge[
Step 1. What do we have?

Step 2. How are people using our products?
]

???
These are enticing opportunities, but work has to be done to get us there. I think there are two main steps to move toward the revenue drivers on the previous slide, and each of these has more granular steps and milestones along the way.

---

# What do we have?

--

.xlarge[
- What types of data are collected?
]

--

.xlarge[
- Where are they stored?
]

--

.xlarge[
- What scoring schema are used across sims?

  + What validity research could be conducted to support sims' use?
]

???
So let's look at the first big question: What do we have?
- First stage of work will be discovery to answer these questions
- Hopefully the IT department will be able to help out with the first couple questions. 
  - I already know about the types of data that are sent to ATI as users go through the simulation: node selections, score values, etc. 
  - I'm guessing there are other variables to use, as well: demographics, user behavioral data, etc.
- Is there a database architecture? A pipeline?
- Already starting to talk with IDs about scoring schema used across sims - would be great to have documentation on this and establish a consistent framework and/or set of decision rules
- Also related to scoring, there are lots of possibilities for validity research that could be conducted to support sims' use and examine user outcomes.

---

# How are people using it?

.xlarge[
- Basic usage statistics

  + User demographics

  + Attempts

  + Frequency of sim use
]

???
The next question is even more complicated. I think there are several ways to look at how people are using our products. 

Usage stats are an easy way to get some basic information on the user population. Some examples of things we could look at:

---

# How are people using it?

.xlarge[
- Score distributions

  + Overall scores

  + Subscores

  + Nodes selected
]

???
Score distributions would be another quick win to see how simulations are performing. Some examples of data points that could be easily aggregated:

---

# How are people using it?
.xlarge[
- Use of key features

  + Coach feedback

  + Undos

  + Other interactive features
]

???
And finally, the use of key features within sims could provide more granular information on what users find useful. For example:

---

class: inverse

# Marketing - materials and targeting

.xlarge[
- Validity research to support claims
]

--

.xlarge[
- Information about feature use to support claims
]

--

.xlarge[
- Predictive modeling to support targeting
]

???
So how do those steps relate back to the three main ways I identified to use data to drive revenue?

First, let's look at how marketing could be improved: 
  - Validity research can support new marketing claims about product quality
  - Information about how features are used can support claims about their usefulness
  - A bit more advanced - predictive modeling based on user demographics could support targeted marketing to subgroups

---

class: inverse

# User retention and UX

.xlarge[
- Information about feature use to drive UX decisions
]

--

.xlarge[
- A/B testing to test UX features
]

--

.xlarge[
- Predictive modeling for user retention
]

???
The second main point was about user retention and UX. 
  - Information about how features are used can drive decisions about what to emphasize in UX
  - We can also do A/B testing to try out new UX features and make data-driven choices about updates
  - I can also see a use case where we could design an algorithm to make smart recommendations to users about what to do next, driving user retention.

---

class: inverse

#Productize user score data

.xlarge[
- Data dashboards to show use and scores
]

--

.xlarge[
- Outcomes research to drive validity claims
]

--

.xlarge[
- Predictive modeling to predict future success
]

???
Finally, the last big way to derive value from data science would be to productize user score data. 
  - Analytics dashboards could help clients understand their use across sims and roll up their scores
  - Outcomes research could drive validity claims, which would then lead to 
  - Predictive modeling - if we can define what future success looks like for clients, we can develop algorithms to predict their likelihood of attaining that success.
